  This_is_my_legacy  
  For people here I love.  
## content
    I aim to write documents containing tricks I learn from people and myself about this very almost first job I have.
    This project would be friendly to freshmen and hopefully helpful for some high-level staff like Miss Cindy.  
    Hopefully this helps.  
    This project would contain but not only several things as following:  
## 1
excel
## 2
sql
## 3
python
## 4
machine learning
## 5
methodology
